3:58 PM - sleep time: "Ehhhhh...... it feels like you're imposing on others how the game should be played and working to actively hinder groups in a team-based shooter just because its shutting down a server full of randoms."
man im so relieved someone gets it
3:58 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: You can be a group that works together without doing the highly specific thing that makes it impossible for high-skilled coordinated players to play the game
3:59 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF MULTIPLAYER GAME DESIGN IS TO GIVE PLAYERS A SPECIFIC SET OF TOOLS TO COMPETE IN SPECIFIC AREAS
3:59 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: THIS AREA IS NOT PART OF THE COMPETITIVE DESIGN OF THE GAME
3:59 PM - sleep time: i can, dont mean i have to
3:59 PM - sleep time: dont mean i should have to
4:00 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: You are incredibly selfish if you think having fun at other peoples' expense is something that should be protected from opposition
4:00 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: That's just pure bullshit
4:00 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: Fuck off
4:00 PM - sleep time: and you arnebt being selfish by trying to destroy groups of people who want to play the game
4:00 PM - sleep time: the fuck kind of bullshit is this "you can play the game with people but you cant do this this and that"
4:09 PM - ABANDONCULTURE is now Online.
4:09 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: Gee
4:09 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: People are being selfish and ruining the game for other people
4:09 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: LET'S STOP THEM FROM DOING THAT
4:09 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: "NO THAT'S NOT OK THAT'S SELFISH"
4:09 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHO I PLAY AGAINST ALL I CARE ABOUT IS THE GAME
4:09 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: YOU ARE MAKING ME OUT TO HAVE FEELINGS THAT I DON'T HAVE
4:10 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHEN THE ENEMY TEAM I PLAY AGAINST IS A STACK BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S NOT A PROBLEM WHEN IT HAPPENS
4:10 PM - sleep time: man you'te being selfish as fuck right now if you're telling me i cant play the game with friends if they're too good
4:10 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I literally never said that
4:10 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I laid out all the specific things I have problems with
4:10 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: YOU CAN PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS AS LONG AS YOU DON'T RUIN THE GAME IN A VERY HIGHLY SPECIFIC WAY
4:10 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: THERE ARE WAYS TO PLAY THE GAME WITH FRIENDS WITHOUT DOING THIS
4:10 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: ALL YOU'RE DOING IS CONTINUING TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU ALREADY DO IT
4:10 PM - sleep time: ok what the fuck is this specific wat
4:10 PM - sleep time: way
4:10 PM - sleep time: wanna fucking clarify that
4:10 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I HAVE EXPLAIN IT REPEATEDLY
4:11 PM - sleep time: being on the same team?
4:11 PM - sleep time: is that it?
4:11 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: YOU CANNOT BE THIS STUPID
4:11 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I HAVE SAID
4:11 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: REPEATEDLY
4:11 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: THE SPECIFIC THINGS
4:11 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
4:11 PM - sleep time: WELL SAY IT AGAIN JUST TO BE CLEAR
4:11 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: NO
4:11 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: FUCK OFF
4:11 PM - sleep time: "A SPECIFIC WAY" IS NOT TELLING ME JACK SHIT
4:11 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I WILL BE REPEATING MYSELF TO THE END OF TIME
4:11 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSATND IF YOU CANNOT GO BACK AND READ THE STRAIGHTFORWARD UNAMBIGUOUS MESSAGES THAT I'VE LEFT THERE
4:11 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: YOU'VE EVEN SHOWN A SHRED OF UNDERSTANDING THIS BEFORE
4:12 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: ALL YOU'RE DOING IS WANTONLY IGNORING SOMETHING YOU KNOW IS A PROBLEM
4:12 PM - sleep time: THE ONLY THING IM GETTING OUT OF THIS IS YOU'RE FUCKING PISSED BECAUSE YOU'RE LOSING TO A GROUP OF PLAYERS BETTER THAN YOU
4:12 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I HAVE ALREADY SAID
4:12 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: THAT THIS HAS \
4:12 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: *ABSOLUTELY*
4:12 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: *NOTHING*
4:12 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: TO DO WITH ME LOSING AGAINST OTHER PLAYERS
4:12 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: *MULTIPLE TIMES*
4:12 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: YOU ARE DRAWING THAT INTO WHAT I'M SAYING BECAUSE YOU REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT I HAVE SUCH HIGHLY SPECIFIC BELIEFS
4:13 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT
4:13 PM - sleep time: >Some people derive fun from playing the game with friends, others prefer to play the game solo just to play the game.

You can play the game with friends without doing the one specific common thing that I happen to dislike.
4:13 PM - sleep time: I SEE ZERO SPECIFIC
4:13 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE EVEN THAT ONE VERY POST
4:13 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: IT *IS THERE*
4:13 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: YOU *CAN UNDERSTAND*
4:13 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I HAVE *ALREADY EXPRESSED MYSELF TIME AND TIME AGAIN*
4:13 PM - sleep time: JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT, DOESNT MEAN I CAN
4:14 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: IF YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE CONVERSATION, DON'T ACT LIKE YOU HAVE A SAY IN IT
4:14 PM - sleep time: You can, just don't break the match's balance after doing so
4:14 PM - sleep time: IS THIS IT?
4:14 PM - sleep time: DOES IT DISDAGREE WITH WHAT I FUCKING SAID?
4:14 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: YES
4:14 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: YES IT DOES
4:14 PM - sleep time: HOW SO HUH?
4:14 PM - sleep time: ARE WE SPECIFICALLY ABUSING ALL THE CHEATCODES IN THE GAME?
4:14 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: And no, "butt-buddying over comms in pubs" is not the kind of teamwork GG2 should reward

Obscure, exclusive subcommunities are *the thing* that kills small online games like this
4:15 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: When I say stacking I don't necessarily mean a whole team of good players, just good players deliberately going where the people they know are to team up against pubs
4:15 PM - sleep time: so i cant play with friends? or i cant play with friends that are good at the game??
4:15 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: You cannot honestly believe that going out of your way to make it easy to shit on people is fun.
4:15 PM - sleep time: i dont
4:15 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: "Heavy teamwork and coordination" was not anywhere on the design list for this game nor TF2; it's an imagined ideal based on a handful of concepts that are already in place. The game even has elements that are designed directly around breaking up coordinating players. The problem is that they don't work against skill curves, and if they did, everyone would scream bloody murder; conversely, they're used less-often by coordinating players because of their rogue nature.
4:15 PM - sleep time: you cannot honestly believe people do thar
4:15 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: They do
4:15 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: You're naive
4:15 PM - sleep time: they dont
4:15 PM - sleep time: what makes you so sure?
4:16 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: You're a fucking idiot if you can honestly say nobody would go out of their way to do something shitty to other people
4:16 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I know for a fact that people do it because I've been there while they were doing it at times and seen them talk about how they were doing it and knew what they were doing
4:16 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: More than just one isolated incidence
4:16 PM - sleep time: everytime i play with a group of people, the only person i have ever seen people stack against is heenok
4:16 PM - sleep time: deliberately*
4:16 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: "
Finally I'd like to point out that "teaming up together" and "teamwork/coordination" are not and never were necessarily the same thing. The groups I'm complaining about have coordination as thin as a sheet of paper. It's just the fact that they stand in the same place and shoot the same things that they ruin half the maps in the game. There's nothing advanced about that, and it's something that pubs will never develop independently of people they're bonded with."
4:16 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: "High dependence on individual skill is a simple trait of shooters, even quakeworld team fortress and TFC weren't huge on the kind of braindead buttbuddying we see in TF2 and GG2; being able to completely shit on disorganized, highly skilled groups by being lowly-skilled yourself but having a basic level of nearby coordination with no tactics or strategy is a design flaw."
4:16 PM - sleep time: what so its a sin to suck at coordinating now?
4:17 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: You honestly have not actually understood the argument that you jumped into at all
4:17 PM - sleep time: cut the crap with the direct attacks and get back on point
4:17 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I have already explained in detail opinons that I have that are *DIRECTLY OPPOSITE* to the picture you paint of me
4:17 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: You're the one making direct attacks
4:18 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: You're insulting my supposed selfishness and narrowmindedness when in fact I have a highly sophistocated viewpoint and know exactly what I want
4:18 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: Eat the butter that you spread on my bread
4:18 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: Put your money where your mouth is
4:18 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: If you can make stupid statements about other people with no grounding in reality, I can make stupid statements about you with actual grounding in your stupid statements about other people
4:18 PM - sleep time: im insulting you? you're insulting me for not agreeing what whatever you're say8ing
4:19 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I'm insulting for you for not understanding my argument in the first place
4:19 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: You keep repeating yourself about how I am and it's both entirely false and not even an argument
4:19 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: You can fuck off until you understand the problem
4:19 PM - sleep time: "The groups I'm complaining about have coordination as thin as a sheet of paper."
so coordination that fucking sucks
4:20 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: Again
4:20 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: Fuck off
4:20 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I'm blocking you; you're never going to understand when it's me that explains it because you just want to make a boogeyman out of me
4:20 PM - sleep time: you're saying its a problem, that its difficult to fight AGAINST an UNCOORDINATED team?? i find it difficult to fight WITH one
4:20 PM - ABANDONCULTURE: I've explained myself in detail and it's your job to figure out what I mean
4:20 PM - sleep time: ive done the same
