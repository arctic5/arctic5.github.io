In order to give off the impression that the hardworking devs of gang garrison 2 actually work, I came to shitpost today's progress to GG2 Final

Today's progress:
- Complete a Feature Request [url=http://www.ganggarrison.com/forums/index.php?topic=35480.0]that I've been holding off for more than a year now[/url]. But I still remembered to do it so don't worry!!!!

- Attempted to recolor meow's animations to match skele's new palette...but there were too many sprites and I gave up!! I'm sorry!

Side rant:
It's also hard to weed out the good feature requests that are worth considering and the feature requests that are plain garbage that make me have zero hope in feature requests ever having a good thread.

Below is a the number of bad threads on the first page

And then we move on to the second page to find more!
